# Ebisu

Personal productivity RPG. Quest management, skill tracking, ritual routines.

Built because free online tools are fragmented. One app, all features, with gamification.

## Features

- **Quests**: Tasks with Eisenhower matrix prioritisation and weighted wheel selection
- **Rituals**: Morning/evening routines with progress tracking
- **Skills**: D&D-style abilities (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA) levelled through quests
- **Streaks**: Daily activity tracking with XP rewards
- **Achievements**: Unlock milestones as you progress

## Install

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Build

flutter build web      # Web
flutter build apk      # Android
flutter build ios      # iOS
flutter build macos    # macOS

```

## CI/CD
